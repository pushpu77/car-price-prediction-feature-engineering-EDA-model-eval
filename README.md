# car-price-prediction-feature-engineering-EDA-model-eval

1. Conducted preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA to study about the feature importance and correlations for 55k datasets 
2. Developed a predictive model to find used car prices using LR, PR, RF and XGBRegressor to obtain best result polynomial regression of score 0.6
3. Hypertuned the parameters using GridSearch to obtain the best R2 score of 0.62 with Poly Regression
